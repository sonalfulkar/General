Where to find datasets:

There are a surprising number of open datasets on the web.  There are also a number of excellent websites which help keep track of where to find datasets.  Rather than attempt to recreate the good work from these teams, here's where you can find these collections:

UCI's Machine Learning Repository - UC Irvine maintains a fantastic collection of datasets for machine learning, tagged by machine learning task (among other things).  If you want to try out the ideas from Week 7, this is the place to start.

Kaggle - Online collection of datasets.  Kaggle also has competitions for data mining and information about jobs in data science.

KDnuggets Dataset - Another collection of datasets - most of the datasets are free. Within KDnuggets, there are links for government data,  Data APIs,  and Data Mining Competitions.

If this seems like information overload, feel free to just get started with data at some of our favorite sites: US Government Data, UK Government Data, Canada's Open Data Exchange, World Health Organization, and the World Bank. 

Remember, finding a dataset of interest and exploring it is most of your job for Week 9!  So expect this to take some time - and that's both perfectly normal and completely okay.
